## Introduction

<img src="https://www.gleech.org/img/attack.jpg" alt="hacker" width="400"/>  
I am a third year bachelor student majoring in linguistics in university of Helsinki. I studied English for two years before changing my major to general linguistics. My main interests in the field are Natural Language Processing and semantics. I also study computer science as my minor. Currently, I'm writing my BA thesis about detection of deceptive language. My thesis will be focusing on emotion words and how their usage differs in deceptive and truthful language.

I'm 22 years old and I live in Helsinki. Two of my main hobbies are video games (especially MOBAs and digital card games) and wildlife photography.
